### Project to demonstrate how data science can be used to address business needs: Performance of YouTube channels on surfing :surfer:
This project serves the purpose of providing insights on the factors that drives views for different YouTube channels about surfing with the ultimate aim of producing channel-specific reports such as [this](https://github.com/daphteh/Scraping_Cleaning_EDA_Surfing_Videos/blob/a621dd743177ec2882fe509c1c138b4a9298a6c6/Report_Images/KB_final.pdf). 

There are several stages and data science skills I leveraged to fulfill this project including:
1. [Data scraping and cleaning](https://github.com/daphteh/Scraping_Cleaning_EDA_Surfing_Videos/tree/main)
